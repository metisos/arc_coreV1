ARC Core Continual Learning Demonstration
==========================================

This script demonstrates how ARC achieves continual learning by:
1. Loading a base model (GPT-2)
2. Testing baseline responses
3. Teaching new information through interactions
4. Showing improved responses after learning
5. Saving and loading learned weights

The base model weights remain frozen while LoRA adapters learn continuously.
